NFT Mint Plan (Revised)

Total Supply: 6,000 NFTs

1. Strategic Rationale

The primary objective of this mint strategy is to maximize mint-out probability while maintaining a healthy and realistic post-mint floor.

Market Benchmark (Monad Ecosystem)

Top Monad NFT on Magic Eden

~3,000 supply

~3,000 MON floor (~USD 60)

Mortal

~1,000 supply

~10,000 MON mint price

Insider-heavy, low supply, not a broad-market benchmark

Conclusion:
Current market conditions indicate that pricing above the ~$60 benchmark significantly increases the risk of not minting out. As a result, pricing and allocation have been intentionally adjusted to reflect real demand, liquidity conditions, and buyer behavior.

Importantly, the project is structured to operate as a sustainable company with the current funding plan, even without minting at $60. The NFT mint is a growth and distribution mechanism, not the sole dependency for execution.

2. Supply Breakdown

Total Supply: 6,000 NFTs

Non-Mintable / Reserved Supply

Presale Allocation: 1,800

MINTHUB COMPANY: 222

TEAM: 222

Total Non-Mintable Supply: 2,244 NFTs

Mintable Supply

Total Mintable NFTs: 3,756

This supply is allocated across Starlist (WL) and FCFS phases.

3. Presale Strategy (Non-Mintable)
Presale Allocation

1,800 NFTs (Reserved / Non-Mintable)

Original assumption:
~900 NFTs at $50

Revised approach:

Increase allocation

Reduce price to maximize early participation

Presale Price

$25 per NFT

4. Mint Pricing Structure (Mintable Phases)
Phase	Mint Price
Starlist (WL)	$35
Public (FCFS)	$40

Pricing remains intentionally below current ecosystem benchmarks to improve mint completion probability.

5. Community-First Allocation & Market Adjustment (Announcement Step)
Announcement Statement

Due to current market conditions, we have made a strategic decision to prioritize our community over artificial scarcity.

To reflect real demand and liquidity in the Monad NFT ecosystem:

Mint pricing has been adjusted to remain below market benchmarks

Starlist (WL) allocation will be intentionally overallocated to the community

FCFS will remain highly competitive to absorb remaining demand

This approach is designed to maximize participation, fairness, and mint-out probability while ensuring long-term sustainability for the project.

Purpose of This Step

Responds transparently to market conditions

Signals community-first execution

Reduces no-show and under-mint risk

Aligns supply with actual demand

6. Starlist (Whitelist) Phase

The Starlist phase (WL) will be intentionally overallocated.

Rationale

Accounts for inactive or low-conversion wallets

Ensures broader community access

Improves utilization before FCFS

7. FCFS (First Come First Serve)

The FCFS phase will be heavily overallocated.

Why Overallocate FCFS

Creates urgency and competition

Captures demand overflow from Starlist

Maximizes probability of full public mint

8. NFT Launchpad & Infrastructure

The NFT launchpad was originally planned with Kingdomly, however they are unable to proceed.

We have completed UI/UX design, but smart contract development is not yet finalized.

Launchpad Execution Options

There are two viable paths forward:

Option 1: Use another established NFT launchpad

Option 2: Build and deploy our own launchpad (IN-HOUSE)

👉 This decision will be finalized based on execution speed and risk management.

9. Post-Mint Experience & Utility

The post-mint experience will follow a blind box–style reveal, inspired by Azuki Elementals.

Utility Highlights

5–10% lifetime IRL blind box discount

1,000 free IRL blind boxes, unlocked via paid purchases

10. Expected Outcomes

Higher probability of full public mint

Transparent, market-aware execution

Strong community trust

Sustainable company operation regardless of $60 pricing

11. Core Philosophy

We adapt to the market, not fight it.
This mint prioritizes community participation, liquidity, and long-term execution over short-term optics.
